        NCU was born out of a simple vision: Open the doors of biblical education to every believer called to leadership.
        Founded by Paul Crites, our focus remains deeply personalâ€”combining spiritual growth, relevant academics, and global connection. From a single classroom, we have grown into a vibrant, international online community.

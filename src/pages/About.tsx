            New Covenant University was established in 1987 by Dr. Paul Crites with a founding principle to mentor leaders with a focused strategy of discovering each student's life purpose and strengthen each student's skill set for success in the marketplace of ideas. It all began with Dr. Crites' pragmatic and biblical approach of teaching purpose and order in his "School of Purpose" where hundreds of leaders gathered weekly to hear him. Soon the class notes were published into books and training manuals evolving into a state recognized program. Decades later the vision continues providing students with a leadership and ethics focused education by providing a wide array of undergraduate and graduate programs in Leadership, Education, Theology, Ministry and Counseling.

            The first international extension campus began in 2008 providing the same undergraduate and graduate programs of New Covenant University under the name: Destiny Christian College and University. Through the guidance of gifted faculty, relevant guest lecturers and the Great Teacher: The Holy Spirit, it is our goal to see society transform from good to better by affirming and teaching principles in the Holy Scriptures, embodied in the person of Jesus Christ and enabled through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Vision of New Covenant University is to train future leaders in a biblical based curriculum to reform society, renew a God consciousness and reproduce leadership of both character and integrity through technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously.
